A textfile with various notes to whoever else is interested 
in what's coming down the pike and possibly what they could do:

Much of what was in here has been done or rendered moot. Instead here is the current
lay of the land:

-There are observers for ticks and canbus but canbus is not yet done. So, one thing
on the agenda is to complete canbus observer (This has now been submitted but
is being held back from master until after EVCCON.)

-The new board has wifi but we're not using it. A big problem currently is that
we have no good way to set parameter so, while EEPROM is working, it is worthless
because the only way to set it is to change code. So, why use it? For this reason
we don't really read much of anything from EEPROM right now. Suitable code and
webpages need to be constructed to make this all work.

Allow Wifi to remote control all sorts of stuff, connect to internet and send
notifications, etc.
